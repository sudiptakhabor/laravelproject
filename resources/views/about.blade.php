                    The Journal of Joint Replacement is the official journal of National Hip and Knee Joint Replacement Foundation (NKHJRF), started with the sole purpose of propagating authentic research in joint replacement.<br>
We understand that our clinicians are excellent researchers but may not be great authors. Also, the busy clinical practice strongly demotivates the surgeons from data collection, storage, analysis, manuscript writing and publishing. Lack of incentive for researchers (except job promotions for a few), hampers the growth of research significantly. 'Publish or perish' culture has diluted the quality of research and many authentic research works fail to get recognition because of publication bias. Our survey says that the authors feel so tortured during the tedious process of manuscript submission that they literally feel like submitting to the publishers.<br>
JJR is not only ready to deal with these challenges of publication industry but is fully equipped to do so. Showcasing your research outcomes to the world can not get any easier, because our motto is topublish every genuine research, irrespective of its writing quality, novelty, completeness etc. We use technology to make paper publication an enjoyable experience for you. We also employ multiple checks to eliminate grammatical errors, plagiarism, statistical errors, data fraud etc. and maintain the quality of publications.
We firmly believe that research publication industry should be monetized because every successful industry needs monetary support. However, this money should go to the right pockets and not to the big shot publishers.</p>
